# Nanobots Project

![Nanobots](nanobots.jpg)

This repository contains the code for an ambitious project focused on creating nanobots that can revolutionize various fields, including drug delivery, surgery, and environmental cleanup. The nanobots are engineered using cutting-edge materials such as gold, platinum, and carbon nanotubes, and they are programmed to perform specific tasks utilizing optical, magnetic, and electrical stimulation techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Once you have installed the required dependencies, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/nanobots-project.git`.
2. Open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE of your choice.
3. Set the `NANOBOT_TYPE` variable to the desired type of nanobot (e.g., drug delivery, surgery, or environmental cleanup).
4. Run the `main.py` file.

## Results

The project will generate an impressive series of images and videos showcasing the nanobots in action as they perform their designated tasks. These captivating media files will be saved to the `results` directory within the repository.

## To-Do

The nanobots project is an ongoing endeavor, and there are several exciting goals on the horizon, including:

- Improving the accuracy and efficiency of the nanobots in their specific tasks.
- Exploring and developing new applications for nanobots in various industries and fields.
- Scaling up the production of nanobots to enable large-scale deployments and significant impact.
